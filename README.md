# fivem-interiorTracker
A small script to track which interior a player is currently in.

Easily expandable to your liking. The structure I used in the table implies that an interior or interior group consists of multiple rooms with unique IDs. I needed this tool to know if players were in subway/sewer tunnels, so I started with that. You can add more to the table if you want more interiors to be tracked.

Just drive/walk into them and expand the table as you go. All subway/sewer tunnels are already included, even with a small description, to be used by your custom scripts.
